## Problem Statement: Need for Speed - Energy Shift Challenge

This repository is submitted as part of a competitive programming contest. The problem titled "Need for Speed: Energy Shift Challenge" is a race-themed problem that requires careful energy management to traverse a track in the shortest possible time. Please refer to the [statement.md](statement.md) file for the detailed problem statement. The problem can also be found on the Codeforces platform at the following link: [Need for Speed on Codeforces](https://polygon.codeforces.com/p7dsLLl/chayan/need-for-speed) access to 'devanshjain'

## Repository Structure

1. `statement.md` - Contains the comprehensive problem statement for "Need for Speed: Energy Shift Challenge".
2. `gen.cpp` - This is a generator program that creates test data for the problem based on predefined constraints.
3. `sol.cpp` - The solution program for the problem. This program implements the logic to solve the problem as described in the statement.md file.
4. `editorial.md` - This file provides an explanation of the problem, a walkthrough of the solution, and an analysis of the solution's time and space complexity.

## Requirements

Please ensure you have a C++ compiler installed on your system to compile and run the provided C++ files. Both the solution and the generator are written in C++.

## Instructions for Judges

#### To generate test data:

Compile and run `gen.cpp` with the desired inputs:

```bash
g++ gen.cpp -o gen
./gen N L
```

Where N is the number of speed-up pads and L is the total length of the track.

#### To run the solution:
Compile and run sol.cpp:

```bash
g++ sol.cpp -o sol
./sol
```

Then, enter your test data in the format specified in the statement.md file.
