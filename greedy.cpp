/* Greedy method is used when we have to find the most optimal solution from a set of feasible solutions 
   when we have different different choices in it 
   these are basically optimisation problems
   1.Greedy method 
   2.Dynamic programing 
   3.Branch and Bound
  
   Greedy algorithm says that we will solve the problem in stajes
   we will take an input form the function 
   we will include it if it is fisible 
   we will then make sure if it the optimal one 
   
   Algo greedy(a,n)
   {
      for i = 1 to n do
      {
            x = select(i)
            if fisible(x) include it 
            {
               solution = solution + x;
            }
       }
